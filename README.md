written by Julian Blanco
Project state
-------------

**Progress:** Postion soultion converges and works with TREK1000

**Current milestone:** Get a trilateration working with DWM1000 and Thortro's github

**Subsequent milestone:** robustness in code and documentation
=======
**General notice:** 

 * [arduinoDWM1000] Contains all old work, and attempts to get it to work with DWM1000 and an arduino pro mini
 * [matlabLPS] Iterative Least Squared Estimation working for postion solution with TREK1000
 * [pythonLPS] Iterative Least Squared Estimation working for postion solution with TREK1000
